# E-Library
Simple Library Management System developed as a MERN web application.

Capstone project for SENG 513 Fall 2022.

# Usage

- Ensure that Node.js is installed locally. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- For running the web application, two separate terminals are needed to run concurrently.

## Backend

- At the first terminal, navigate to `backend` folder (from root directory).
- Run `npm install` to install the required package dependecies (outlined in [package.json](https://github.com/oBhodrolok/MERNLibrary/blob/main/root/backend/package.json ).
- Run `nodemon`, this will start the backend server (at port 4000 and also establish MongoDB cluster connection).

## Frontend

- At the second terminal, navigate to `root` directory if not already in it.
- Run `npm install`to install the required package dependencies (outlined in [package.json](https://github.com/oBhodrolok/MERNLibrary/blob/main/root/package.json)).
- Run `npm start`, this will run the client side at port 3000 (should automatically open http://localhost:300 at the system's default Web browser.
